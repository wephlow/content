# Breaking Silos on Epstein Drive Overclocking

In fast-moving engineering environments, it’s not a lack of information that slows teams down, it’s the inability to see the full picture. At **Protogen Corp**, critical knowledge around propulsion development was trapped in departmental silos. Engineering had one view. Finance had another. Compliance had context, but it was buried in old email threads.

Enter **Phlow**: a system designed not just to store documents, but to **connect what a company knows, across functions, formats, and people, in real time**.

## Context

Protogen Corp, a mid-sized aerospace engineering firm, was experiencing increasing delays in R&D cycles. Despite having internal reports, financial analyses, and engineering logs on propulsion optimisations, decision-makers struggled to act confidently. Why? The knowledge was scattered, siloed across departments with no unified view.

One recurring technical challenge was “**Epstein Drive Overclocking**”, a complex propulsion enhancement that impacted multiple divisions: Engineering, Finance, Compliance, and Procurement.

## The Challenge

> “_We know we’ve tackled this before. Somewhere. But every team is working with a different version of the truth._”

Teams wasted time chasing documents, redoing analysis, or missing key insights that lived in someone else’s folder or someone else’s head.

## What Phlow Did

We ran a real-world test. The COO entered: “**Tell me what we know of Epstein Drive overclocking**”

Phlow responded instantly, not with one document, but a multi-perspective overview:

- Engineering reports on thrust impact
- Finance risk assessments on fuel consumption overage
- Procurement logs evaluating supplier variance
- Email snippets from a compliance discussion triggered by a past incident

Each item was:

- Automatically tagged with its originating department
- Pulled from distinct folders and authors
- Connected by a shared context, not a shared location

The COO was able to:

- Click into any document to see its full content and provenance
- Traverse from one department’s view to another
- Understand the full picture, not just a sliver

## Outcome

What used to take hours of meetings and Slack messages now took 60 seconds:

- One search
- Unified, cross-departmental insight
- Trust in the completeness of the answer

> “_This isn’t just knowledge management. This is context management._”

## Why It Matters

Most KM systems are built to store. Phlow is built to circulate.

By bridging departmental silos automatically, Phlow turned a chaotic, fragmented knowledge trail into an immediate, strategic advantage.
