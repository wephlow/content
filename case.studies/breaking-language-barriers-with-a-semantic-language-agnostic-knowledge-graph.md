# Breaking Language Barriers with a Semantic, Language-Agnostic Knowledge Graph

In global organisations, knowledge often dies in translation. Not because people are unwilling to share, but because it is stored in a language someone else doesn’t speak. At Protogen Corp, teams were generating valuable insights daily, but most of it stayed confined within linguistic boundaries. Leadership realised that their knowledge problem wasn’t just technical. It was semantic.

They turned to Phlow’s language-agnostic, semantic platform to unify and activate knowledge across the business, regardless of the language it was created in.

### **Context**

Protogen Corp operates across Germany, Brazil, the Netherlands, and more. Each office generated reports, lessons learned, and decisions in their native language. But those insights were rarely used outside their origin.

A risk analysis in Dutch wasn’t helping the French legal team. A fix written in German was unknown to engineers in Brazil.

### **The Challenge**

Knowledge was there. But if it wasn’t in your language, it was effectively gone.

- Important updates weren’t reused across countries
- Collaboration was confined to local teams
- Valuable work was duplicated because it couldn’t be discovered
- Translation requests piled up, slowing response time

### **What Phlow Did**

Phlow introduced a semantic knowledge graph that connects ideas, decisions, and contributors—no matter what language they used.

- Employees created knowledge in their native language
- Phlow indexed it semantically, without relying on keywords
- Team members searched in their own language
- The system returned meaning, not just content, in a language they understood

This meant that an engineer in Stuttgart could document a fix in German. A colleague in São Paulo could ask about a similar issue in Portuguese, and Phlow would return the answer in Portuguese, pulling from the German source.

Phlow didn’t translate files. It understood them.

### **Outcome**

- Teams collaborated across language barriers without effort
- Duplication of work decreased
- Native-language contribution became frictionless
- Knowledge sharing became continuous and automatic

### **Why This Matters**

Most systems store content. Phlow unlocks meaning. It makes knowledge usable, discoverable, and shareable across languages without extra work. In global teams, language should never be the bottleneck. With Phlow, it isn’t.
